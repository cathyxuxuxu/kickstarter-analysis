# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to help Louis, a playwright, to plan her crowdfunding campaign (with an estimated budget of over $10,000) to help her play (Fever). In this project, I used Excel to sort and analyze the crowdfunding data with more than 4000 crowdfunding projects to determine the factors that could make her campaign successful.
## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

In this section, I analyzed the relationship between the number of successful, failed, and canceled campaign for theater category with month of the year. 
From the chart, we can clearly see that the peak of successful campaign is happened in May, while the highest number of failed Kickstarter campaigns are happened in May, July and October. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

In this section, I analyzed the relationship between successful, failed, and canceled percentage of campaign for Play category with the amount of goals. The percentage of successful is the highest when the goal is less than 1000 dollars, and the overall successful rate is decreasing with the increasing of amount of goal. Interestingly, the successful rate starts to rise to around 70% with a relatively lower percentage of failed when the goal range is from 35000 to 44999. When the goal is greater than $45,000, the percentage of successful starts to decline dramatically.


### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
