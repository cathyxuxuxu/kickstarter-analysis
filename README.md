# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to help Louis, a playwright, to plan her crowdfunding campaign (with an estimated budget of over $10,000) to help her play (Fever). In this project, I used Excel to sort and analyze the crowdfunding data with more than 4000 crowdfunding projects to determine the factors that could make her campaign successful.
